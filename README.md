# Fuseki CLI [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Fuseki is a populair SPARQL / Triplestore implementation in Java that is simple and robust to use. See [Jena Apache Jena Fuseki documentation](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/index.html) for more info. The Fuseki CLI is a build as a __TypeScript__ based _wrapper_ to use and support the services that are provided from the Open Source version.
  
## Jena Fuseki Server Dependencies

This pre-release only supports a local Jena Fuseki Service as a peer depedency for this package. See for info how to install and use: [@dgwnu/fuseki-service](https://github.com/dgwnu/fuseki-service).  
_Other server installations could work but are not tested (or in scope). Hint: Any localhost installation should work like HomeBrew but there might be some authorization issues to resolve in "shiro.ini"_

## NPM installation

````
npm install https://github.com/dgwnu/fuseki-cli.git --save
````

## CLI-commands

At this moment there is only some prelimannary support to configure and use Fuseki-services Api.

npx fuseki < ping | server >
````

| Command | Function |

## CLI-library

This package provides a __TypeScript__ based library to reuse and /or extend the CLI-functionality.  
  
Import library in your TypeScript-application and use it to make extended functionality:

````ts
import { ping } from '@dgwnu/fuseki-cli';

// Use Fuseki Server Ping Service
ping.subscribe({
    next: (up) => console.log(up),
    error: (down) => console.log(down)
});

````

The [Fuseki CLI source](src/bin/fuseki-cli.ts) provides all examples you need.
